## How to drive past defender and create separation for shooting
Objective: to dribble is to cause defenders to flip hip; the power to defend comes from the right stance, when defenders lost this; he lost this power

Once defender flipped their hip in the wrong way, it is hard for them to jump or contest your shot.

The trick is to move fast when defender is moving slow; moving slow when defender is moving fast. 

There are 2 ways to do this

### Cause defender to flip the hip in the wrong direction, when you drive hard downhill
When defender flipped the hip, it is hard:
- To stop in time to defend you; need to flip the hips back to defend you
- To jump in opposite momentum
- Defender already lost the right stance to exert power to come towards you

### Attack the top foot, defenders have to flip the hip
